# Machine Learning for Bangkit Capstone
For this Machine Learning side of this project, we're inspired by this Batik pattern recognition [repository](https://github.com/yohanesgultom/deep-learning-batik-classification) by **Machine Learning & Computer Vision (MLCV) Lab, Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia**.

## Dataset Overview
This [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uFnhO8WXdnyTBxGFy1qlqWU4iPmEF0kH/view) contains 645 (but only 640 can be used) different images of 6 different images, consisting of 6 different classes of batik patterns. Among them are:
1. Ceplok
2. Kawung
3. Lereng
4. Mix
5. Nitik
6. Parang

We also use transfer learning method to get our model better. You can refer to this medium to learn about it.
